# Sublime Text 3 SourcePawn Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for the SourcePawn programming language. 

## Installing

Download the files for the language you want. If you prefer the old 1.6 syntax, use the 1point6 file, and if you prefer the 1.7 transitional syntax, of course, use the 1point7 file. A custom color scheme is included and is set to be used by default when viewing .sp/.inc files. If you want to disable that, just delete the `.sublime-settings` file. Extract the files to `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User`.

## Found a bug?

I've tried to ensure that the highlighting works properly, but there may still be some edge cases I haven't discovered yet. If you happen to find one of these edge cases, please do submit an issue report and I'll get right to fixing it.

## Custom include suggestions?

I plan on adding in highlighting for several community-made include files such as TF2Items, TF2Attributes, Colors/MoreColors/MultiColors, and others. If there is an include file that you'd like to see support for added, submit an issue report and use the `custom include` label.
